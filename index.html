            <h1>Article 1</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 1</h2>
                    <p>All legislative powers are given to congress which is made up of two chambers, the house and the
                        senate.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 2</h2>
                    <p>The House of Representatives serves as the lower chamber of Congress, while the Senate
                        constitutes the upper chamber. The allocation of House members to each state is based on its
                        population and is reevaluated every decade. To serve in the House, individuals must be at least
                        25 years old, have a minimum of 7 years of U.S. residency, and reside in the state they
                        represent. In terms of voting, each person's vote carries equal weight, except for individuals
                        in military service, whose votes count as three fifths.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 3</h2>
                    <p>Every state shall be represented by two senators, each serving a six-year term. Senators must
                        meet the following qualifications: they must be at least 30 years of age, have been a U.S.
                        citizen for a minimum of 9 years. The Vice President of the United States serves as the
                        President of the Senate, presiding over its proceedings. Additionally, the Senate holds the
                        power of impeachment and can, with a two-thirds majority vote, impeach and subsequently remove
                        the President from office.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 4</h2>
                    <p>States possess the autonomy to determine the procedures for conducting elections, which
                        encompasses the location, timing, and manner of voting. Congress holds the authority to
                        supervise this process and can make adjustments to ensure a fair election of House members.
                        Additionally, Congress is obligated to convene at least once annually to maintain regular
                        sessions of the legislative body.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 5</h2>
                    <p>For either the House or the Senate to conduct official business, a majority of their respective
                        members must be present. Neither house can adjourn for more than three days without the consent
                        of the other, preventing one house from impeding legislative activities. Both houses possess the
                        authority to compel the attendance of absent members to ensure their responsibilities are
                        fulfilled. Each house establishes its own rules and maintains a journal of their proceedings,
                        which is generally made available to the public unless there is a need for confidentiality.
                        Expulsion of a member from either house requires a two-thirds majority vote.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 6</h2>
                    <p>Members of Congress receive compensation for their service from the U.S. Treasury, with the
                        specific amount determined by law. While discharging their duties, members of Congress are
                        exempt from civil arrest, safeguarding their ability to fulfill their responsibilities without
                        hindrance. During legislative sessions, members of Congress enjoy speech and debate immunity,
                        allowing them to freely express their views. Additionally, members of Congress are prohibited
                        from concurrently holding a position in the executive branch.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 7</h2>
                    <p>All bills related to tax increases or revenue must originate in the House of Representatives. To
                        become law, a bill requires a majority vote in both houses, and it can be introduced in either
                        house. Once passed by both houses, the bill is sent to the President for approval or veto. If
                        the President vetoes the bill, Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds majority vote in
                        both houses. If the President takes no action within ten days, the bill automatically becomes
                        law. However, if Congress adjourns during that period, the bill does not become law, a situation
                        known as a 'pocket veto.'</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 8</h2>
                    <p>Congress holds the authority to impose and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises to
                        generate revenue for the federal government. Additionally, Congress can borrow money on behalf
                        of the United States. The regulation of international relations falls within the purview of
                        Congress. Congress also possesses the power to establish rules for citizenship and enact laws
                        concerning bankruptcy. Exclusive authority rests with Congress for the coinage of money,
                        including setting its specifications such as weight and value. Congress can establish post
                        offices and roads to facilitate national communication. Patents and copyrights are granted by
                        Congress to promote innovation and safeguard intellectual property. Furthermore, Congress is
                        empowered to raise and maintain an army, with funding requiring reauthorization every two years.
                        The ability to call upon a militia and enact laws necessary and proper for executing its
                        enumerated powers is also vested in Congress.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 9</h2>
                    <p>Congress is prohibited from suspending the writ of habeas corpus except in cases of invasion,
                        rebellion, or when public safety necessitates it. Laws of attainder are forbidden. Additionally,
                        ex-post-facto laws cannot be enacted. Direct taxes are apportioned based on the populations of
                        individual states, and exports are exempt from taxation. Congress is barred from granting titles
                        of nobility to prevent the formation of an aristocracy. Treaties require a two-thirds majority
                        for approval, and bills related to revenue must originate in the House of Representatives. The
                        slave trade was also prohibited starting in 1808.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 10</h2>
                    <p>States are prohibited from entering into treaties, alliances, or confederations with foreign
                        nations. The authority to coin money lies exclusively with Congress, and states cannot pass laws
                        that impair contracts. Like Congress, states lack the power to grant titles of nobility. States
                        are also unable to impose taxes on imports and exports. Engaging in war is only permitted in
                        cases of self-defense against invasion, and states cannot engage in warlike activities with
                        other states without the consent of Congress, except in the face of an immediate threat.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 1</h2>
                    <p>The President must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years old, and
                        have been a resident of the U.S. for at least 14 years. The President serves a four-year term
                        with a maximum of two terms. Instead of being directly elected by the people, the President is
                        elected by the Electoral College, with the number of electors determined by each state's
                        representation in Congress. Congress is responsible for tallying the Electoral College votes. In
                        the event of no majority vote, the House of Representatives elects the President from the top
                        three candidates. Before assuming office, the President takes an oath to preserve, protect, and
                        defend the Constitution.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 2</h2>
                    <p>The President serves as the Commander in Chief of the U.S. military. The President possesses the
                        authority to negotiate and sign treaties with the consent of two-thirds of Congress.
                        Additionally, the President can appoint judges, ambassadors, and other officers. When the Senate
                        is in recess, the President can temporarily fill vacant positions, which expire at the end of
                        the Senate's next session. The President is also empowered to grant pardons for crimes, except
                        in cases where the President has been impeached by Congress.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 3</h2>
                    <p>TThe President is required to provide Congress with updates on the State of the Union. The
                        President is expected to recommend legislation to Congress that is deemed essential for the
                        country's well-being. Additionally, the President has the authority to convene and, when deemed
                        necessary, adjourn sessions of Congress.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 4</h2>
                    <p>The President, Vice President, and all officers can face impeachment by Congress for high crimes
                        and misdemeanors. If an official is impeached, the Senate can vote to remove them from office,
                        requiring a two-thirds majority for removal. Following removal from office, the impeached
                        official may also be subject to additional penalties.</p>

                    <p>The judiciary branch is made up by the Supreme Court. Congress has the power to make smaller

                        public ministers, disputes between states, and cases in which the United States is a party. The

                        courts. Criminal defendants are entitled to a trial by jury, with the jury drawn from the state

                        every other state. In short, they must recognize and respect the legal decisions and official

                        not contingent upon membership in the militia, and it is intended to be upheld with minimal
                        government interference.</p>

                    <p>The government cannot make homeowners provide for soldiers. In the case of war quartering
                        soldiers should be done with regulations established by the government, this ensures that
                        quartering is done in a lawful manner.</p>

                    <p>The government cannot search private homes, that person is entitled to their belongings including
                        papers, people, and other property. To conduct a search the government must get a warrant and
                        thi s required that there is reasonable belief that there is a crime committed. The warrant can
                        be bypassed in cases of emergencies. Any evidence collected in violation of the fourth amendment
                        is disregarded. This is so that there is less incentive to search homes.</p>

                    <h2>Amendment 5</h2>

                        compensation; for instance, if a highway needs to be built but a house is on the way, the owner
                        of the house will get compensation.</p>

                        not adjusted for inflation. Once facial evidence is brought up it cannot be reexamined or
                        changed.</p>
