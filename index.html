  <h1 id="top">Top 8 Reasons to NOT 'Love Thy Neighbor,' According to Freud</h1>

  <p><strong>Intro:</strong><br>
    You know the golden rule: <em>"Love thy neighbor as thyself."</em> It sounds nice. Cozy. Even divine. But Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, would likely raise an eyebrow and ask, “Have you met people?” In <em>Civilization and Its Discontents</em>, Freud argues that trying to love your neighbor might actually be hazardous to your mental health—and, in fact, it might go against everything we naturally are. Trying to love everyone equally, to him, isn’t a moral triumph—it’s a setup for disillusionment.

    <h2>1. Humans Are Not Gentle Creatures</h2>
    <img src="/assets/Villainc.svg.png" alt="Humans are not gentle" />
    <blockquote>"Man is not a gentle creature who wants to be loved... he is, on the contrary, someone who is ready to treat his neighbor as an enemy." (p. 68)</blockquote>
    <p>Freud pulls no punches here. Beneath our civilized masks, he says, lies a primal aggressor. We are naturally self-serving, suspicious, and at times violent. The impulse to compete or dominate others is deeply wired into our psyches from an evolutionary standpoint. Civilization barely keeps this in check. So, when someone tells you to “just love everyone,” remember: you’re not just going against society—you’re fighting your own survival programming.</p>

  <div class="reason" id="reason2">
    <h2>2. Civilization Demands Repression</h2>
    <img src="/assets/1_3PLPJZttJJpJ6Wh49YKJQw.jpg" alt="Civilization requires repression" />
    <blockquote>"The existence of civilization presupposes the non-gratification (suppression, repression, or something else?) of powerful instinctual urgencies." (p. 18)</blockquote>
    <p>Freud emphasizes that civilization works by suppressing our base desires—especially those linked to aggression and sexuality. These instincts don’t disappear; they just get buried, leading to internal pressure. Loving your neighbor, especially when it feels obligatory or artificial, can stir up that inner conflict. The more society tells us to love, the more some people feel compelled to resist. It’s a psychological tug-of-war between what we feel and what we’re told we should feel.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="reason" id="reason3">
    <h2>3. Love Makes Us Vulnerable</h2>
    <img src="/assets/trust-fall-never-trust.gif" alt="Love makes us vulnerable" />
    <blockquote>"We are never so defenceless against suffering as when we love." (p. 11)</blockquote>
    <p>Love, in Freud’s view, opens us up to the sharpest pains imaginable—loss, betrayal, jealousy, rejection. These aren’t rare consequences either; they’re baked into the very act of loving. The more we care, the more we have to lose. Freud sees love not as a shield, but as an exposure, a weakening of our defenses that leaves us emotionally at risk. So when society tells us to love everyone, it’s asking us to walk around defenseless in a world that isn’t built to be kind.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="reason" id="reason4">
    <h2>4. Religion Sells a Dangerous Illusion</h2>
    <img src="/assets/635918323282801631-religion-MarkSkalny-GettyImages-istockphoto.webp" alt="Religion is an illusion" />
    <blockquote>"Religion succeeds in saving many people from individual neuroses. But little more." (p. 12)</blockquote>
    <p>Religious systems often promote love as a divine imperative, but Freud saw this as an illusion—one meant to soothe fear and control behavior. By encouraging love for all, religion asks people to suppress their natural instincts and replace them with an unrealistic ideal. Freud believed that this created inner conflict, as individuals struggle to reconcile these expectations with their lived emotional reality. It might reduce neuroses on the surface, but it also distorts the psyche beneath.</p>

  <div class="reason" id="reason5">
    <h2>5. Sublimation Doesn’t Work for Everyone</h2>
    <img src="/assets/05-frustration-1024x724.jpg" alt="Sublimation doesn't work for all" />
    <blockquote>"This kind of satisfaction... is not generally applicable; it is only available to the few." (p. 9)</blockquote>
    <p>Freud believed that some people could take their aggressive or sexual urges and turn them into socially productive outlets—like art or intellectual work. This is sublimation. But it’s not a universal skill. Most people, he argued, don’t find meaningful relief through these channels. If loving others is just another sublimation strategy, it’s one that will only work for a select few. For the majority, it feels forced, leading to frustration, guilt, or even resentment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="reason" id="reason6">
    <h2>6. The Pleasure Principle Is Doomed Anyway</h2>
    <img src="/assets/pexels-photo-14860485.jpeg" alt="The pleasure principle fails" />
    <blockquote>"The intention that man should be happy is not included in the scheme of Creation." (p. 8)</blockquote>
    <p>Freud was deeply skeptical about the idea that happiness was achievable, let alone sustainable. He believed that the structure of existence—biological decay, social conflict, and inner turmoil—makes lasting pleasure impossible. Even noble efforts like loving others are caught in this trap. They may offer moments of joy, but they’re ultimately unsatisfying because they fail to overcome the deep, built-in suffering of human life.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="reason" id="reason7">
    <h2>7. Society Thrives on Injustice</h2>
    <img src="/assets/lady-justice-blindfolded_55d3389af74020f6.jpg" alt="Society prefers order to love" />
    <blockquote>"The first requisite of culture, therefore, is justice—that is, the assurance that a law once made will not be broken in favour of any individual." (p. 17)</blockquote>
    <p>According to Freud, civilizations require laws to suppress individual desires and ensure order. But this structure is inherently unfair to the individual, who must give up freedom and instinctual satisfaction. Love, particularly when applied universally, disrupts that system. It doesn’t respect the boundaries of law or hierarchy. It tries to override justice with feeling, which makes it socially destabilizing—and something Freud believes society ultimately can’t afford.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="reason" id="reason8">
    <h2>8. Most People Don’t Even Want to Work Together</h2>
    <img src="/assets/images.jpg" alt="People want protection, not partnership" />
    <blockquote>"The ordinary man cannot imagine this Providence in any other form but that of a greatly exalted father." (p. 7)</blockquote>
    <p>Freud argues that most people aren’t genuinely interested in collaboration or equality. They crave authority, protection, and certainty—usually from some idealized figure like a father or God. This dependency mindset undermines the kind of mutual respect and reciprocity that loving one’s neighbor requires. If people don’t actually want to meet others as equals, universal love becomes an empty gesture, not a lived practice.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="conclusion" id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Freud doesn’t just question the golden rule—he throws it under the bus. In his view, loving your neighbor isn’t just difficult, it’s psychologically and socially unrealistic. Civilization demands structure, control, and repression—not emotional vulnerability. Even well-meaning ideas like universal love become diluted, vulnerable to betrayal, and ultimately in conflict with the deeper architecture of our minds and societies. So next time someone says “just love everyone,” maybe ask: <em>“But why, though?”</em> Freud might just nod in agreement.</p>
