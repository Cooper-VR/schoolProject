            <h1>Article 1</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 1</h2>
                    <p>All legislative powers are given to congress which is made up of two chambers, the house and the senate.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 2</h2>
                    <p>The house of representatives is the lower chamber, and the senate is the upper house of congress.The number of members in the house for each state is done by population and is recounted every 10 years. Members of the house must be at least 25 years of age, be a US resident for at least 7 years, and live in the state they represent. In voting each person counts as 1, except for people in service. Their vote counts as three fifths. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 3</h2>
                    <p>Each state will have 2 senators. They will have a 6 year term. They must be at least 30 years old and a US citizen for at least 9 years. The president of the senate is the Vice president of the US.They also have the role of impeachment and with a two thirds majority they can impeach and remove the president from office.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 4</h2>
                    <p>States have authority on deciding on how votes should be conducted, this includes place, time, and manner. Congress has the power to oversee this process and can alter it for a fair election of members of the house. Congress also has to meet at least once a year so that congress remains in session at regular times.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 5</h2>
                    <p>In order for the house or the senate to conduct official business more than half of the members must be present at that time. Neither one of the houses can adjourn for more than three days without the consent of the other house, this ensures that one house isn't preventing legislative activities. Each house has the authority to compel the attendance of absent members, ensuring that members fulfill their duties. Both houses create their own rules and must keep a journal of their findings. These journals must be published to the public unless they need to be secret. Members of both houses can expel members of their respective house with a two thirds majority.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 6</h2>
                    <p>Members of congress will receive compensation for their service from the US treasury. The amount is determined by law. While performing their duty, members of congress are immune to civil arrest, this ensures that they will not be hindered in performing their duties. During section members of congress have speech and debate immunity so that they can express their view freely. Members of congress cannot also hold a position in the executive branch.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 7</h2>
                    <p>All bills for raising taxes or increasing revenue are to originate in the house of representatives. For a bill to become a law it needs to have a majority in both houses, the law can be proposed by either house. Once it's a law it's sent to the president to approve or veto it, if he vetoes it congress can override it with a two thirds majority in both houses. If the president doesn’t do anything within ten days it becomes a law. However if congress adjourns during that period then it is not a law, this is called a “pocket veto”</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 8</h2>
