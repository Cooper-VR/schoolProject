                <li>
                    <h2>Section 1</h2>
                    <p>All legislative powers are given to congress which is made up of two chambers, the house and the
                        senate.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 2</h2>
                    <p>The house of representatives is the lower chamber, and the senate is the upper house of
                        congress.The number of members in the house for each state is done by population and is
                        recounted every 10 years. Members of the house must be at least 25 years of age, be a US
                        resident for at least 7 years, and live in the state they represent. In voting each person
                        counts as 1, except for people in service. Their vote counts as three fifths. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 3</h2>
                    <p>Each state will have 2 senators. They will have a 6 year term. They must be at least 30 years old
                        and a US citizen for at least 9 years. The president of the senate is the Vice president of the
                        US.They also have the role of impeachment and with a two thirds majority they can impeach and
                        remove the president from office.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 4</h2>
                    <p>States have authority on deciding on how votes should be conducted, this includes place, time,
                        and manner. Congress has the power to oversee this process and can alter it for a fair election
                        of members of the house. Congress also has to meet at least once a year so that congress remains
                        in session at regular times.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 5</h2>
                    <p>In order for the house or the senate to conduct official business more than half of the members
                        must be present at that time. Neither one of the houses can adjourn for more than three days
                        without the consent of the other house, this ensures that one house isn't preventing legislative
                        activities. Each house has the authority to compel the attendance of absent members, ensuring
                        that members fulfill their duties. Both houses create their own rules and must keep a journal of
                        their findings. These journals must be published to the public unless they need to be secret.
                        Members of both houses can expel members of their respective house with a two thirds majority.

                <li>
                    <h2>Section 6</h2>
                    <p>Members of congress will receive compensation for their service from the US treasury. The amount
                        is determined by law. While performing their duty, members of congress are immune to civil
                        arrest, this ensures that they will not be hindered in performing their duties. During section
                        members of congress have speech and debate immunity so that they can express their view freely.
                        Members of congress cannot also hold a position in the executive branch.</p>

                    <p>All bills for raising taxes or increasing revenue are to originate in the house of
                        representatives. For a bill to become a law it needs to have a majority in both houses, the law
                        can be proposed by either house. Once it's a law it's sent to the president to approve or veto
                        it, if he vetoes it congress can override it with a two thirds majority in both houses. If the
                        president doesn’t do anything within ten days it becomes a law. However if congress adjourns
                        during that period then it is not a law, this is called a “pocket veto”</p>
