            <p>1This text of the Constitution follows the engrossed copy
                signed by Gen. Washington and the deputies from 12 States. The
                small superior figures preceding the paragraphs designate
                clauses, and were not in the original and have no reference to
                footnotes.
                In May 1785, a committee of Congress made a report recommending an alteration in the Articles of Confederation, but
                no action was taken on it, and it was left to the State Legislatures to proceed in the matter. In January 1786, the Legislature
                of Virginia passed a resolution providing for the appointment of
                five commissioners, who, or any three of them, should meet such
                commissioners as might be appointed in the other States of the
                Union, at a time and place to be agreed upon, to take into consideration the trade of the United States; to consider how far a
                uniform system in their commercial regulations may be necessary to their common interest and their permanent harmony;
                and to report to the several States such an act, relative to this
                great object, as, when ratified by them, will enable the United
                States in Congress effectually to provide for the same. The Virginia commissioners, after some correspondence, fixed the first
                Monday in September as the time, and the city of Annapolis as
                the place for the meeting, but only four other States were represented, viz: Delaware, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; the commissioners appointed by Massachusetts, New
                Hampshire, North Carolina, and Rhode Island failed to attend.
                Under the circumstances of so partial a representation, the commissioners present agreed upon a report, (drawn by Mr. Hamilton, of New York,) expressing their unanimous conviction that
                it might essentially tend to advance the interests of the Union
                if the States by which they were respectively delegated would
                concur, and use their endeavors to procure the concurrence of
                the other States, in the appointment of commissioners to meet
                at Philadelphia on the Second Monday of May following, to take
                into consideration the situation of the United States; to devise
                such further provisions as should appear to them necessary to
                render the Constitution of the Federal Government adequate to
                the exigencies of the Union; and to report such an act for that
                purpose to the United States in Congress assembled as, when
                agreed to by them and afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures
                of every State, would effectually provide for the same.
                Congress, on the 21st of February, 1787, adopted a resolution in
                favor of a convention, and the Legislatures of those States which
                had not already done so (with the exception of Rhode Island)
                promptly appointed delegates. On the 25th of May, seven States
                having convened, George Washington, of Virginia, was unanimously elected President, and the consideration of the proposed
                constitution was commenced. On the 17th of September, 1787, the
                Constitution as engrossed and agreed upon was signed by all the
                members present, except Mr. Gerry of Massachusetts, and
                Messrs. Mason and Randolph, of Virginia. The president of the
                convention transmitted it to Congress, with a resolution stating
                how the proposed Federal Government should be put in operation, and an explanatory letter. Congress, on the 28th of September, 1787, directed the Constitution so framed, with the resolutions and letter concerning the same, to ‘‘be transmitted to
                the several Legislatures in order to be submitted to a convention
                of delegates chosen in each State by the people thereof, in conformity to the resolves of the convention.’’
                On the 4th of March, 1789, the day which had been fixed for
                commencing the operations of Government under the new Constitution, it had been ratified by the conventions chosen in each
                State to consider it, as follows: Delaware, December 7, 1787;
                Pennsylvania, December 12, 1787; New Jersey, December 18, 1787;
                Georgia, January 2, 1788; Connecticut, January 9, 1788; Massachusetts, February 6, 1788; Maryland, April 28, 1788; South Carolina, May 23, 1788; New Hampshire, June 21, 1788; Virginia, June
                25, 1788; and New York, July 26, 1788.
                The President informed Congress, on the 28th of January, 1790,
                that North Carolina had ratified the Constitution November 21,
                1789; and he informed Congress on the 1st of June, 1790, that
                Rhode Island had ratified the Constitution May 29, 1790. Vermont, in convention, ratified the Constitution January 10, 1791,
                and was, by an act of Congress approved February 18, 1791, ‘‘received and admitted into this Union as a new and entire member
                of the United States.’’ 2The part of this clause relating to the mode of apportionment
                of representatives among the several States has been affected by
                section 2 of amendment XIV, and as to taxes on incomes without
                apportionment by amendment XVI. 3This clause has been affected by clause 1 of amendment XVII.
                CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA—1787 1
                WE THE PEOPLE of the United States, in Order to
                form a more perfect Union, establish Justice,
                insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the
                common defence, promote the general Welfare,
                and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of
                America.
                ARTICLE. I.
                SECTION 1. All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United
                States, which shall consist of a Senate and
                House of Representatives.
                SECTION. 2. 1The House of Representatives
                shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States,
                and the Electors in each State shall have the
                Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most
                numerous Branch of the State Legislature. 2 No Person shall be a Representative who
                shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five
                Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the
                United States, and who shall not, when elected,
                be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall
                be chosen. 3 Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may
                be included within this Union, according to
                their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free
                Persons, including those bound to Service for a
                Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed,
                three fifths of all other Persons.2 The actual
                Enumeration shall be made within three Years
                after the first Meeting of the Congress of the
                United States, and within every subsequent
                Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall
                by Law direct. The Number of Representatives
                shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand,
                but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be
                made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, RhodeIsland and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four,
                Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland
                six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South
                Carolina five, and Georgia three. 4When vacancies happen in the Representation
                from any State, the Executive Authority thereof
                shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies. 5The House of Representatives shall chuse
                their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have
                the sole Power of Impeachment.
                SECTION. 3. 1The Senate of the United States
                shall be composed of two Senators from each
                State, chosen by the Legislature thereof,3 for six
                Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.
                CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA—1787 Page II
                4This clause has been affected by clause 2 of amendment
                XVIII.
                5This clause has been affected by amendment XX. 6This clause has been affected by amendment XXVII.
                2 Immediately after they shall be assembled in
                Consequence of the first Election, they shall be
                divided as equally as may be into three Classes.
                The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall
                be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year,
                of the second Class at the Expiration of the
                fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may
                be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies
                happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the
                Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature,
                which shall then fill such Vacancies.4
                3 No Person shall be a Senator who shall not
                have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and
                been nine Years a Citizen of the United States,
                and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen. 4The Vice President of the United States shall
                be President of the Senate, but shall have no
                Vote, unless they be equally divided. 5The Senate shall chuse their other Officers,
                and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United
                States. 6The Senate shall have the sole Power to try
                all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation.
                When the President of the United States is
                tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no
                Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present. 7Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not
                extend further than to removal from Office, and
                disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of
                honor, Trust or Profit under the United States:
                but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be
                liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.
                SECTION. 4. 1The Times, Places and Manner of
                holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the
                Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at
                any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators. 2The Congress shall assemble at least once in
                every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the
                first Monday in December,5 unless they shall by
                Law appoint a different Day.
                SECTION. 5. 1Each House shall be the Judge of
                the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its
                own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller
                Number may adjourn from day to day, and may
                be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such
                Penalties as each House may provide. 2Each House may determine the Rules of its
                Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly
                Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two
                thirds, expel a Member. 3Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the
                same, excepting such Parts as may in their
                Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and
                Nays of the Members of either House on any
                question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those
                Present, be entered on the Journal. 4 Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other,
                adjourn for more than three days, nor to any
                other Place than that in which the two Houses
                shall be sitting.
                SECTION. 6. 1The Senators and Representatives
                shall receive a Compensation for their Services,
                to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the
                Treasury of the United States.6 They shall in all
                Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the
                Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their
                Attendance at the Session of their respective
                Houses, and in going to and returning from the
                same; and for any Speech or Debate in either
                House, they shall not be questioned in any other
                Place. 2 No Senator or Representative shall, during
                the Time for which he was elected, be appointed
                to any civil Office under the Authority of the
                United States, which shall have been created, or
                the Emoluments whereof shall have been
                encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be
                a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.
                SECTION. 7. 1 All Bills for raising Revenue shall
                originate in the House of Representatives; but
                the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills. 2Every Bill which shall have passed the House
                of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before
                it become a Law, be presented to the President
                of the United States; If he approve he shall sign
                it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on
                their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If
                after such Reconsideration two thirds of that
                House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be
                sent, together with the Objections, to the other
                House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that
                House, it shall become a Law. But in all such
                Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the
                Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be
                entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the
                President within ten Days (Sundays excepted)
                after it shall have been presented to him, the
                Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had
                signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall
                not be a Law. 3Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which
                the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the
                President of the United States; and before the
                Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by
                him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of
                Representatives, according to the Rules and
                Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.
                SECTION. 8. 1The Congress shall have Power To
                lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Ex-
                Page III CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA—1787

                cises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United
                States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall
                be uniform throughout the United States; 2To borrow Money on the credit of the United
                States; 3To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations,
                and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes; 4To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States; 5To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof,
                and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of
                Weights and Measures; 6To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the
                United States; 7To establish Post Offices and post Roads;
                8To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
                respective Writings and Discoveries; 9To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court; 10To define and punish Piracies and Felonies
                committed on the high Seas, and Offences
                against the Law of Nations; 11To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and
                Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures
                on Land and Water; 12To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a
                longer Term than two Years; 13To provide and maintain a Navy; 14To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces; 15To provide for calling forth the Militia to
                execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; 16To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such
                Part of them as may be employed in the Service
                of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and
                the Authority of training the Militia according
                to the discipline prescribed by Congress; 17To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases
                whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding
                ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United
                States, and to exercise like Authority over all
                Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for

                United States, or in any Department or Officer
                thereof.
                SECTION. 9. 1The Migration or Importation of
                such Persons as any of the States now existing
                shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty
