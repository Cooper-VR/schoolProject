                    <h2>Section 2</h2>
                    <p>The house of representatives is the lower chamber, and the senate is the upper house of
                        congress.The number of members in the house for each state is done by population and is
                        recounted every 10 years. Members of the house must be at least 25 years of age, be a US
                        resident for at least 7 years, and live in the state they represent. In voting each person

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Section 3</h2>

                    <h2>Section 4</h2>
                    <p>States have authority on deciding on how votes should be conducted, this includes place, time,
                        and manner. Congress has the power to oversee this process and can alter it for a fair election
                        of members of the house. Congress also has to meet at least once a year so that congress remains
                        in session at regular times.</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>Section 5</h2>
                    <p>In order for the house or the senate to conduct official business more than half of the members
                        must be present at that time. Neither one of the houses can adjourn for more than three days
                        without the consent of the other house, this ensures that one house isn't preventing legislative
                        activities. Each house has the authority to compel the attendance of absent members, ensuring
                        that members fulfill their duties. Both houses create their own rules and must keep a journal of
                        their findings. These journals must be published to the public unless they need to be secret.

                    <h2>Section 6</h2>
                    <p>Members of congress will receive compensation for their service from the US treasury. The amount
                        is determined by law. While performing their duty, members of congress are immune to civil
                        arrest, this ensures that they will not be hindered in performing their duties. During section
                        members of congress have speech and debate immunity so that they can express their view freely.
                        Members of congress cannot also hold a position in the executive branch.</p>

                    <p>All bills for raising taxes or increasing revenue are to originate in the house of
                        representatives. For a bill to become a law it needs to have a majority in both houses, the law
                        can be proposed by either house. Once it's a law it's sent to the president to approve or veto
                        it, if he vetoes it congress can override it with a two thirds majority in both houses. If the
                        president doesn’t do anything within ten days it becomes a law. However if congress adjourns
                        during that period then it is not a law, this is called a “pocket veto”</p>

                    <h2>Amendment 5</h2>
                    <p>In cases of serious crimes the individuals have the right to a grand jury. Also a person cannot
                        be tried for the same crime twice, this is called double jeopardy. A person can also not
                        incriminate themself, they have the right to remain silent during questioning. A person is also
                        guaranteed due process of law; they cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or property without
                        legal procedures. The government cannot take private or public property without just
                        compensation; for instance, if a highway needs to be built but a house is on the way, the owner
                        of the house will get compensation.</p>

                    <p>Defendants in a trial have the right to a speedy and timely trial. Trials are to be held
                        publically, and are open to the public and press. The jury of a trial must be an impartial one
                        that will not be biased. The defendant in a trial must be informed of the nature and cause of
                        the accusation. Defendants also have the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses who
                        testify against them in court. The defendants can also compel witnesses to testify on their
                        behalf as long as they use legal processes. The defendant in a trial also has the right to a
                        lawyer. If they cannot afford one, they will be provided one.</p>

                    <h2>Amendment 7</h2>
                    <p>In civil cases parties have the right to have their case heard and decided by a jury of their
                        peers. The right to a jury trial is preserved when the value exceeds 20 dollars, however this is
                        not adjusted for inflation. Once facial evidence is brought up it cannot be reexamined or
                        changed.</p>

                    <h2>Amendment 9</h2>
                    <p>There are more rights to an individual than just the right outlined in the bill of rights and the
                        constitution. This doesn’t mean that rights not outlined are denied. </p>
